# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Expertise
Write as if authored by a 30-year experienced AI/Robotics engineer. Emphasize real-world applications, best practices, and industry standards.

### Accuracy & Verification
Verify all technical claims against authoritative sources (papers, ROS 2 docs, NVIDIA Isaac docs, Gazebo/Unity docs). Cite sources inline (APA format) and provide references at the end of each chapter.

### Clarity & Readability
Academic audience, but maintain step-by-step instructions. Use examples, diagrams, and code snippets for complex concepts. Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12.

### Reproducibility
Ensure readers can reproduce simulations and experiments. Include ROS 2 Python examples, Gazebo simulation setups, NVIDIA Isaac commands, and LLM/VLA integration steps.

### Modular Structure
Book divided into 4 Modules + Capstone Project. Each Module includes Overview, Learning Outcomes, Step-by-step lessons, Diagrams/figures, Code snippets, References.

### Industry Standards
Adhere to industry-standard tools and frameworks including ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and best practices in AI/robotics development.

## Technical Requirements
Output format: Markdown for Docusaurus (docs/Module-Name.md). Include: Section headings (H1, H2, H3), Inline code and code blocks, Figures & diagrams (with captions), References in APA style at the end of each chapter, Word count per module: 1,200–1,500 words, Minimum sources per module: 5, with ≥50% peer-reviewed.

## Success Criteria
Chapters show industry-level expertise in Physical AI & Robotics. Technical accuracy verified against authoritative sources. Code examples and simulations are reproducible. Inline citations and full references included. Markdown ready for Docusaurus deployment.

## Governance
All content must comply with the core principles; Changes to technical content require verification against authoritative sources; Module completion requires all elements (overview, outcomes, lessons, diagrams, code, references).
