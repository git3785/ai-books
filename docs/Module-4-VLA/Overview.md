# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration

This module focuses on Vision-Language-Action integration for humanoid robots. You'll learn how to integrate LLMs with humanoid robots for voice-command control and cognitive planning, covering multi-modal perception that combines vision, language, and action. The module also covers deployment on edge AI hardware like Jetson Orin Nano/NX.

## Multi-Modal Integration Concepts

Multi-modal integration combines information from different sensory inputs to create a more comprehensive understanding and response system:

- **Vision**: Processing visual information from cameras and sensors
- **Language**: Understanding spoken and written commands
- **Action**: Executing physical movements and manipulations
- **Gestures**: Recognizing and responding to visual cues and body language
- **Haptic**: Sensing touch and physical interaction feedback

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Implement voice-to-action commands using OpenAI Whisper
2. Translate natural language commands into ROS 2 action sequences
3. Understand multi-modal integration workflows (speech, gesture, vision) for humanoid robots
4. Deploy VLA systems on Jetson edge hardware
5. Apply cognitive planning techniques for humanoid robots using LLMs
6. Integrate multiple sensory inputs for enhanced robot perception and decision-making
