# Learning Outcomes: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration

After completing this module, learners will be able to:

## Core Competencies

- **Implement Voice-to-Action Systems**: Successfully integrate OpenAI Whisper with humanoid robots to process voice commands and translate them into robotic actions

- **Design NLP Pipelines**: Create natural language processing pipelines that translate human commands into executable ROS 2 action sequences

- **Map Actions in ROS 2**: Implement ROS 2 action servers that respond to commands generated from processed natural language

- **Deploy on Edge Hardware**: Configure and deploy VLA systems on Jetson Orin Nano/NX hardware for real-world applications

## Technical Skills

- Utilize OpenAI Whisper API for speech-to-text processing in robotic contexts
- Apply GPT-4 for cognitive planning and decision-making in humanoid robots
- Integrate multi-modal perception systems (vision, language, action)
- Optimize VLA systems for edge computing constraints
- Validate system performance in both simulation and real-world environments

## Application Knowledge

- Design workflows for multi-modal AI integration in robotics
- Implement sensor fusion for speech, vision, and gesture recognition
- Create cognitive planning systems that respond to natural language commands
- Evaluate and optimize system performance for humanoid robot control
