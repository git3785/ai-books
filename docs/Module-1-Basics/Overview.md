# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware that serves as the nervous system for modern robotics applications. You'll learn how ROS 2 enables communication between different components of a robotic system, manages distributed computing, and provides tools for building complex robotic applications.

## Understanding ROS 2 as the Robotic Nervous System

ROS 2 is more than just a framework—it's the central nervous system of modern robots. Just as the nervous system coordinates different parts of a biological organism, ROS 2 coordinates different software components, sensors, actuators, and algorithms within a robotic system.

### Key Concepts of ROS 2 Architecture

- **Nodes**: Independent processes that perform specific functions within the robotic system
- **Topics**: Communication channels for publishing and subscribing to data streams
- **Services**: Request-response communication patterns for specific tasks
- **Actions**: Goal-oriented communication with feedback and status updates
- **Parameters**: Configuration values that can be dynamically adjusted
- **Launch Systems**: Tools for starting multiple nodes simultaneously

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Explain the core concepts and architecture of ROS 2
2. Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes for robot communication
3. Implement publisher-subscriber communication patterns
4. Use services for request-response interactions
5. Configure parameters for robot systems
6. Launch complex robot systems with multiple coordinated nodes
7. Debug and monitor ROS 2 communications using built-in tools
